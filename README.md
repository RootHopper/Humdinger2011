- 👋 Hi, I’m @Humdinger2011 aka Joseph A. Hagerty
- 👀 I’m currently interested in distributed systems, data stores, configuration management, gitflow, containerization, serverless, devops best-practices, technical writing, creative writing, and improvisional musical performance.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Terraform, Kubernetes, Rancher, Helm, Fleet, Ansible, and how to be a more precise, rhythmic jamming partner. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any of the above, especially jamming.
